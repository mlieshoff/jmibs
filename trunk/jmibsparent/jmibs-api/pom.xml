    <!-- @doc jMibs/I/Introduction{jMibs is a Java micro-benchmarking suite.}-->
    <!-- @doc jMibs/II/Getting Started Guide{This guide is intended to show about the first use
    of jMibs and introduce in the base application.}-->
    <!-- @doc jMibs/II/Getting Started Guide/1. What is jMibs?{jMibs is a benchmarking suite to
    execute micro several benchmarks. It tries to answer the questions about performance. How
    many micro-seconds my algorithm need to be completed? When i try it 10.000 times, will it
    constant perform oder non-perform? If i uses thousands of objects in, how many seconds it
    need to be compledted? jMibs tries to work this job. You can define own benches and
    access own classes to check out the performance. You can extend jMibs with basic principles
    of Java software development. The try is to make extension easy.}-->
    <!-- @doc jMibs/II/Getting Started Guide/2. How do i setup?{Setup is easy as possible. Get
    the jMibs archive file and use the archive on your classpath.}-->
